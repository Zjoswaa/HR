For this assignment I took my project from last week and added some effect to it to create space.

First, I added the Utility plugin and enabled the mono filter on it so while editing, I hear the mono output and not stereo.

I also added the reverb plugin and set it to a low-cut input filter, I also increased the decay sligtly and increased the "wetness (?)" of the reverb to 60% from 55%.

After that, I added a some delay to the saxophone, this sounded fun. I then also added a delay to the acoustic guitar and I liked how that sounded so I kept it in.

My version of Ableton does not have the EQ Eight and Subtle Stereo plugin so I sadly could not add these.

I liked how the result sounded, it really adds to the flanger effect that I added last week.
