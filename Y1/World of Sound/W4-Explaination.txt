This track starts with a violin, a viola and a ukulele as the main components, later in the track the vocalist is also added.

I added compressors to the ukulele, violin, viola, bass, cello and vocalist. I lowered the emphasis on the ukulele, violin and viola so that you can hear the bass and the cello more clearly. I also lowered the vocalist a bit.

I like the sound of the cello in this song so that is why I wanted to emphasise that instrument, the bass adds really nicely to the cello as well.
