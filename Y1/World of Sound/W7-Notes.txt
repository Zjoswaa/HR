This week: Creativity

Mr DJ says: "experiment a lot."

Change the direction of tracks, add eq's and saturators, basically fuck around and find out.

The issue with digital is that there are few limitations, so you can go overboard.
Its good to use the "mixing desk" approach, so use the Send A & Send B knobs and put plugins on the sent track.

What if you don't take this approach and embrace the modern way:
 - Nodes: Connect nodes using vertices and get a good visual representation of your tracks. Is this the future of mixing? Mr DJ finds it too complicated and less clear.

Experimenting is fun but at some point, you need a plan on where to start, else you get a mess because of the few limitations you have.

Sampling: Taking a (multi)track and adding on it, you can create sounds that you were not able to create before using sampling.
