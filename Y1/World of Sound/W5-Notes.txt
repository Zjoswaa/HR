Today: Harmonics

Adding other sound waves with a certain multiple of frequency as another wave creates a harmonic, this represents other octaves of the same note.

This is important when creating a digital version of for example a piano, which has multiple overtones.

piano good, always fits. If it plays the same notes as another instrument, it adds nice harmonics.

Very boring, add more plugins :D
 - Saturator, it fills the gap between the fundamental en harmonic notes, MORE SAUSAGE-LIKE, similar effect to compressor. To bake sound, use it on (almost) everything, not too much and ususally only at the end of your project.
 - Vinyl Distortion, dinggggg
 - Overdrive, kkkccchhhhhh
 - Pedal, kkkchhhhh v2
 - (Flanger) waaaoowwwaeeooo, it adds ripple, tame impala effect
 - (Phaser)

When mixing, constantly think about the sound you cant to achieve.

You don't want multiple instruments to play the same note, you get sounds on the same harmonic continent, very nasty.

Ableton: Ctrl + G = Group plugins together
