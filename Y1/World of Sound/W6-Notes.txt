You can emulate the direction a sound is coming from by changing the timing on the left and right side, you trick your brain into thinking it came from another direction.

Stereo - Mono, a sound can sound good in stereo but then bad when you change it to mono.

Utility: Change a sound from stereo to mono.
Reverb: Creates depth, echo-like sound, it emulates being in a room. It moves a sound further away, a danger with this is that a sound may dissapear because it is to far away.

Send tracks to the reverb return track by sliding the A knob.

How to create direction in sound:
 - Volume, usually not a good way, it makes mono sound more quiet. (Subtle Stereo)
 - Frequency, using an equalizer, seperate left and right and make them the opposite of eachother. Weakest effect, works when changing to mono. (EQ Eight)
 - Time, one side plays a bit later than the other, 25ms delay is the max that still sounds okay. Works great on vocals and bass and works when changing to mono. (Filter Delay)

When recording a sound and the microphones have a slight delay because one is further away, it can sound quieter in mono because some frequencies will cancel eachother out.

Phase-issues occur when using multiple microphones.
High frequencies are less phase-issue prone than low frequencies because samples happen faster and more often.


Plugins
Utility to test if it sounds good in mono
Reverb to create more space
Subtle Stereo
Filter Delay (without filter) to use more time difference. Simons favorite! 1 ms + 25 ms is the sweet spot for a stereo effect
EQ Eight to recreate the HEAD effect ðŸ”¥
